# Training and Serving ML Models on GPU with NVIDIA Triton

## Introduction

Data scientists or machine learning engineers who looks to train models at scale with good performance eventually
hit a point where they start to experience various degrees of slowness on the process. For example, tasks that
usually were taking minutes to complete are now taking hours, or even days when datasets get larger. Such situation
is particularly common when training Deep Learning models, for neural networks the training phase is the most
resource-intensive task. While training, a neural network takes in inputs which are then processed in hidden
layers using weights that are adjusted during training and the model then outputs a prediction. Weights are adjusted to
find patterns in order to make better predictions. Both operations are essentially composed by matrix multiplications.

Taking in consideration a neural network with around 10, 100 or even 100,000 parameters, a computer would still be able
to handle this in a matter of minutes, or even hours at the most. However a neural network with more than 10 billion
parameter would probably take years to train on the same system.

To overcome that problem GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are usually used for training neural networks. GPUs are optimized
for training artificial intelligence and deep learning models as they can process multiple computations simultaneously.
Additionally, GPUs have their own dedicated memory which allows it to compute huge amounts of data with higher bandwidth
resulting in the training phase being much faster.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use FuseML together with
[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server) to not only train a neural network,
but also serve it in a timely manner by taking advantage of the GPU. We will start by using k3d to create a local kubernetes
cluster with two nodes exposing the the GPU to one of them. After that, we will install FuseML then create and execute a workflow
that trains the model and then serves it, as a validation step we will not be using the GPU yet. Once the model is validated, we
will improve its accuracy by increasing number of epochs used when training the model, by doing that it is expected that the training
time would increase considerably, however as the training will be performed on GPU it will be rather quick.

## Setup

### Create the Kubernetes Cluster

In order to run FuseML locally, we will be using [k3d](https://k3d.io/). K3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal
Kubernetes distribution) in docker making it very easy to create single and multi-node k3s clusters. The Kubernetes nodes created by k3d
are docker containers running k3s with containerd, in that way, we need to be able to run GPU accelerated Docker containers so that it can
expose the GPU to containerd. Besides, we also need to build a custom k3s image that also contains the NVIDIA Container Runtime and
configures containerd to use that runtime.

#### Running GPU accelerated Docker containers

We need to install [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) be able to run GPU accelerated docker containers. Before getting
started, ensure that the following requirements are met by your system:

- GNU/Linux x86_64 with kernel version > 3.10
- Docker >= 19.03 (recommended, but some distributions may include older versions of Docker. The minimum supported version is 1.12)
- NVIDIA GPU with Architecture >= Kepler (or compute capability 3.0). You can check you GPU architecture at [CUDA Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported)
- NVIDIA Linux drivers >= 418.81.07 (Note that older driver releases or branches are unsupported.)

##### Installing NVIDIA Docker

The instructions provided here are for OpenSUSE Leap 15.3. For other supported distributions please refer to the
[nvidia-docker official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).

1. Install the NVIDIA driver:

   The recommended way to install drivers is to use the package manager for your distribution, however as the driver from the package
   manager did not work properly for OpenSUSE, we will be using the driver from the
   [NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us). We will be installing the NVIDIA driver version 470.74,
   you might need to check for the latest available driver compatible with your GPU.

   Installing the driver:

   ```bash
   wget https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/470.74/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.74.run

   chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.74.run.

   ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.74.run
   ```

   After installing the driver make sure to reboot your system.

2. Install Docker:

   Run the following command to install Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo zypper install -y docker
   ```

3. Add your user to the docker group.

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

4. Ensure Docker service is running and test your Docker installation by running the hello-world container and checking its output:

   ```bash
   $ sudo systemctl --now enable docker

   $ docker run --rm hello-world
   Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
   latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
   2db29710123e: Pull complete
   Digest: sha256:37a0b92b08d4919615c3ee023f7ddb068d12b8387475d64c622ac30f45c29c51
   Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

   Hello from Docker!
   This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

   To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
   1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
   2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
       (amd64)
   3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
       executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
   4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
       to your terminal.

   To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
   $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

   Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
   https://hub.docker.com/

   For more examples and ideas, visit:
   https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
   ```

5. Install nvidia-docker:

   The nvidia-docker package is available through a nvidia repository provided for for OpenSUSE Leap 15.1, however
   it also works for OpenSUSE Leap 15.3. Add the repository and install it by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo zypper ar -f https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/opensuse-leap15.1/nvidia-docker.repo
   sudo zypper install nvidia-docker2
   ```

   When installing nvidia-docker it will overwrite the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file by configuring docker to use the NVIDIA
   container runtime. Make sure that it has the following contents:

   ```bash
   $ cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
   {
       "runtimes": {
           "nvidia": {
               "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
               "runtimeArgs": []
           }
       }
   }
   ```

6. Restart the Docker daemon to complete the installation and test it by running a CUDA container:

   ```bash
   $ sudo systemctl restart docker

   $ docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi

#### Build a custom K3s image

The native K3s image is based on Alpine which is not supported by the NVIDIA container runtime. To get around that we need to build
the image using a supported base image. The following instructions are based on the
[official k3d documentation](https://k3d.io/v5.0.0/usage/advanced/cuda/)

1. Create a Dockerfile with the content below:

   ```Dockerfile
   ARG K3S_TAG="v1.21.5-k3s1"
   ARG CUDA_VERSION="11.4"

   FROM rancher/k3s:$K3S_TAG as k3s

   FROM nvidia/cuda:${CUDA_VERSION}.0-base-ubuntu20.04

   RUN echo 'debconf debconf/frontend select Noninteractive' | debconf-set-selections

   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get -y install gnupg2 curl

   # Install NVIDIA Container Runtime
   RUN curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/gpgkey | apt-key add -

   RUN curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/ubuntu20.04/nvidia-container-runtime.list | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-runtime.list

   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get -y install nvidia-container-runtime

   COPY --from=k3s /bin /bin/

   RUN mkdir -p /etc && \
       echo 'hosts: files dns' > /etc/nsswitch.conf

   RUN chmod 1777 /tmp

   # Provide custom containerd configuration to configure the nvidia-container-runtime
   RUN mkdir -p /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/containerd/

   COPY config.toml.tmpl /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/containerd/config.toml.tmpl

   # Deploy the nvidia driver plugin on startup
   RUN mkdir -p /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests

   COPY device-plugin-daemonset.yaml /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/nvidia-device-plugin-daemonset.yaml

   VOLUME /var/lib/kubelet
   VOLUME /var/lib/rancher/k3s
   VOLUME /var/lib/cni
   VOLUME /var/log

   ENV PATH="$PATH:/bin/aux"

   ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/k3s"]
   CMD ["agent"]
   ```

   This Dockerfile uses nvidia/cuda as base image and installs the NVIDIA container runtime on it, adds a configuration file
   for containerd setting it to use the NVIDIA container runtime and adds the NVIDIA device plugin daemonset so it can start
   automatically when creating the cluster.

2. In the same directory, create the containerd configuration file, named `config.toml.tmpl` with the following content:

   ```toml
   [plugins.opt]
     path = "{{ .NodeConfig.Containerd.Opt }}"

   [plugins.cri]
     stream_server_address = "127.0.0.1"
     stream_server_port = "10010"

   {{- if .IsRunningInUserNS }}
     disable_cgroup = true
     disable_apparmor = true
     restrict_oom_score_adj = true
   {{end}}

   {{- if .NodeConfig.AgentConfig.PauseImage }}
     sandbox_image = "{{ .NodeConfig.AgentConfig.PauseImage }}"
   {{end}}

   {{- if not .NodeConfig.NoFlannel }}
   [plugins.cri.cni]
     bin_dir = "{{ .NodeConfig.AgentConfig.CNIBinDir }}"
     conf_dir = "{{ .NodeConfig.AgentConfig.CNIConfDir }}"
   {{end}}

   [plugins.cri.containerd.runtimes.runc]
     # ---- changed from 'io.containerd.runc.v2' for GPU support
     runtime_type = "io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux"

   # ---- added for GPU support
   [plugins.linux]
     runtime = "nvidia-container-runtime"

   {{ if .PrivateRegistryConfig }}
   {{ if .PrivateRegistryConfig.Mirrors }}
   [plugins.cri.registry.mirrors]{{end}}
   {{range $k, $v := .PrivateRegistryConfig.Mirrors }}
   [plugins.cri.registry.mirrors."{{$k}}"]
     endpoint = [{{range $i, $j := $v.Endpoints}}{{if $i}}, {{end}}{{printf "%q" .}}{{end}}]
   {{end}}

   {{range $k, $v := .PrivateRegistryConfig.Configs }}
   {{ if $v.Auth }}
   [plugins.cri.registry.configs."{{$k}}".auth]
     {{ if $v.Auth.Username }}username = "{{ $v.Auth.Username }}"{{end}}
     {{ if $v.Auth.Password }}password = "{{ $v.Auth.Password }}"{{end}}
     {{ if $v.Auth.Auth }}auth = "{{ $v.Auth.Auth }}"{{end}}
     {{ if $v.Auth.IdentityToken }}identitytoken = "{{ $v.Auth.IdentityToken }}"{{end}}
   {{end}}
   {{ if $v.TLS }}
   [plugins.cri.registry.configs."{{$k}}".tls]
     {{ if $v.TLS.CAFile }}ca_file = "{{ $v.TLS.CAFile }}"{{end}}
     {{ if $v.TLS.CertFile }}cert_file = "{{ $v.TLS.CertFile }}"{{end}}
     {{ if $v.TLS.KeyFile }}key_file = "{{ $v.TLS.KeyFile }}"{{end}}
   {{end}}
   {{end}}
   {{end}}
   ```

3. Finally, create the `device-plugin-daemonset.yaml` file with the following content.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: DaemonSet
   metadata:
     name: nvidia-device-plugin-daemonset
     namespace: kube-system
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         name: nvidia-device-plugin-ds
     updateStrategy:
       type: RollingUpdate
     template:
       metadata:
         annotations:
           scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: ""
         labels:
           name: nvidia-device-plugin-ds
       spec:
         tolerations:
           - key: CriticalAddonsOnly
             operator: Exists
           - key: nvidia.com/gpu
             operator: Exists
             effect: NoSchedule
         nodeSelector:
           accelerator: gpu
         priorityClassName: "system-node-critical"
         containers:
           - image: nvidia/k8s-device-plugin:1.0.0-beta4
             name: nvidia-device-plugin-ctr
             securityContext:
               allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
               capabilities:
                 drop: ["ALL"]
             volumeMounts:
               - name: device-plugin
                 mountPath: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins
         volumes:
           - name: device-plugin
             hostPath:
               path: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins
   ```

   Note that the daemonset definition includes a `nodeSelector` to ensure that it is only scheduled on
   nodes with the `accelerator=gpu` label. The NVIDIA device plugin is a daemonset that exposes the number
   of GPUs available on the nodes, keep track of the GPUs health and enable running GPU enabled containers.

4. With all those files on the same directory, build the image running the following command:

   ```bash
   docker build . -t k3s:v1.21.5-k3s1-cuda --build-arg CUDA_VERSION=X.X
   ```

   Replace `X.X` with the latest cuda version supported by your GPU which can be found by running the following
   command:

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi | awk '/CUDA/ { print $9 }'
   ```

5. Test the image built by running the following commands to create a cluster and deploy a test pod:

   ```bash
   k3d cluster create gputest --image=k3s:v1.21.5-k3s1-cuda --gpus=1 --k3s-node-label "accelerator=gpu@server:0"
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: cuda-vector-add
   spec:
     restartPolicy: OnFailure
     containers:
       - name: cuda-vector-add
         image: "k8s.gcr.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1"
         resources:
           limits:
             nvidia.com/gpu: 1
   EOF
   ```

   Wait for the pod to finish running and check its logs, it should output something like:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl logs cuda-vector-add
   [Vector addition of 50000 elements]
   Copy input data from the host memory to the CUDA device
   CUDA kernel launch with 196 blocks of 256 threads
   Copy output data from the CUDA device to the host memory
   Test PASSED
   Done
   ```

   If the pod is stuck in `Pending` state, check the logs from the pod created by NVIDIA device
   plugin daemonset. If it succeeds you can delete the test cluster by running the following
   command:

   ```bash
   k3d cluster delete gputest
   ```

#### Create the Kubernetes cluster

Run the following command to create a cluster with 2 nodes where one of them is labeled with
`accelerator=gpu`,we also disable traefik and expose the http port to allow accessing the
dashboards from FuseML extensions:

```bash
k3d cluster create fuseml --image=k3s:v1.21.5-k3s1-cuda --gpus=1 --agents 2 --k3s-node-label 'accelerator=gpu@agent:0'  --k3s-arg '--disable=traefik@server:0' -p '80:80@loadbalancer'
```

#### Install FuseML

1.  Get the fuseml-installer:

    ```bash
    $ curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuseml/fuseml/main/install.sh | bash
    Verifying checksum... Done.
    Preparing to install fuseml-installer into /usr/local/bin
    fuseml-installer installed into /usr/local/bin/fuseml-installer
    Run 'fuseml-installer --help' to see what you can do with it.
    ```

    Make sure you have `kubectl` and `helm` installed. If not, refer to the following links to install them:

    - kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/
    - helm: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

2.  To install FuseML run the following command, note that we are also installing the mlflow and kserve
    extensions which will be used for model tracking and serving respectively:

    ```bash
    fuseml-installer install --extensions mlflow,kserve
    ```

    !!! note

        FuseML will automatically assign a domain based on the cluster load balancer IP address in the format
        `<LB_IP>.nip.io`. If you want to use a different domain, you can use the `--system-domain` flag. In the
        rest of this tutorial we will use `192.168.86.74.nip.io` as the domain. Any reference to `<FUSEML_DOMAIN>`
        should be replaced by your domain.

## Training & Serving the model

As GPU is usually a limited and costly resource, instead of testing/developing the model using a GPU it might
make sense to validate the model first on CPU with a minimum training configuration (small dataset, small number
of epochs, batch size, etc). To do that we will run a FuseML workflow that will train the model and serve it on
CPU. This will also enable us to compare CPU and GPU performance during the training.

For that experiment we will be training a
[Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#convolutional_neural_network)
to classify [CIFAR images](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) using the Keras Sequential API.
The complete original code for the model training is available [here](https://github.com/fuseml/examples/tree/main/codesets/mlflow/keras). The code we're using in this tutorial is a modified version of the original: the model architecture has been slightly changed, to make the model converge faster and to yield better results, based on recommendations from [this Machine Learning Mastery article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-cnn-from-scratch-for-cifar-10-photo-classification/).

### Training & Serving using FuseML

The following steps describe how to use FuseML to train the model and serve it.

1. Clone the `fuseml/examples` repository and register the `keras` example code as a FuseML codeset:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/fuseml/examples.git

   $ fuseml codeset register -n cifar10 -p demo examples/codesets/mlflow/keras
   Pushing the code to the git repository...
   Codeset http://gitea.192.168.86.74.nip.io/demo/cifar10.git successfully registered
   ```

2. Create a FuseML workflow:

   ```bash
   $ fuseml workflow create examples/workflows/mlflow-e2e.yaml
   Workflow "mlflow-e2e" successfully created
   ```

   This workflow includes steps for training and serving the model. When serving `Keras` models, unless
   `predictor` is set to a specific value instead of `auto` on the workflow, FuseML will automatically
   serve the model using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.

   Note: Alternatively, you could use different example workflow, like `examples/workflows/mlflow-seldon-triton-e2e.yaml`.
   This one also uses NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, but with the help of Seldon Core instead of Kserve.

3. Assign the `mlflow-e2e` workflow to the `cifar10` codeset:

   ```bash
   $ fuseml workflow assign -c cifar10 -p demo -n mlflow-e2e
   Workflow "mlflow-e2e" assigned to codeset "demo/cifar10"
   ```

4. Wait for the workflow run to finish running:

   By assigning the workflow to the codeset, a workflow run will be created. You can check the status
   of the workflow run by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ fuseml workflow list-runs
   +--------------------------------------+------------+----------------+----------+---------+
   | NAME                                 | WORKFLOW   | STARTED        | DURATION | STATUS  |
   +--------------------------------------+------------+----------------+----------+---------+
   | fuseml-demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-tkgls | mlflow-e2e | 14 seconds ago | ---      | Running |
   +--------------------------------------+------------+----------------+----------+---------+
   ```

   You can also see a more detailed view of the workflow run through the tekton dashboard, which should
   be available at: `http://tekton.<FUSEML_DOMAIN>`

   Note that since this is the first time the workflow is running, it will build a docker image including
   the dependencies for training the model which may take a while. However, consecutive runs will skip that
   step as long as the dependencies are kept the same.

### Validating the Deployed Model

Before querying the served model for predictions, lets take a look at MLflow for detailed information about
the model, such as its accuracy, loss, training parameters, etc.

MLflow should be available at `http://mlflow.<FUSEML_DOMAIN>`.

For example:

<figure markdown> 
  ![MLflow](img/kserve-triton-gpu/mlflow.png)
  <figcaption>Training metrics on CPU</figcaption>
</figure>

Note the accuracy (about 70%) and the training duration (about 4 minutes) for 10 epochs.

With the successful execution of the workflow, a new FuseML application should have been created. List the
FuseML applications:

```bash
$ fuseml application list
+-------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| NAME                    | TYPE      | DESCRIPTION                                  | URL                                                                                                          | WORKFLOW   |
+-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e | predictor | Application generated by mlflow-e2e workflow | http://demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e.fuseml-workloads.192.168.86.74.nip.io/v2/models/demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e/infer | mlflow-e2e |
+-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+
```

The list of FuseML applications include a URL to query the model for predictions. As FuseML is using the
KServe extension for serving the model, you can check the deployed models through the KServe
dashboard (`http://kserve-web-app.<FUSEML_DOMAIN>/`) which also includes more detailed
information such as the status of the deployment, logs, etc.

For example:

<figure markdown> 
  ![KSserve Dashboard](img/kserve-triton-gpu/kserve.png)

To validate the model, we need to send a request containing an image so the model can to predict its class.

The json file included in the `fuseml/examples` repository contains a sample request that represents the
following deer image:

<figure markdown> 
  ![Deer](img/kserve-triton-gpu/deer.png){width="300"}
  <figcaption>Deer Sample Image</figcaption>
</figure>

Run the following command to send the request to the application URL:

```bash
$ curl -sX POST http://demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e.fuseml-workloads.192.168.86.74.nip.io/v2/models/demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e/infer -d @examples/prediction/data-keras.json | jq
{
  "model_name": "demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e",
  "model_version": "1",
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "dense_1",
      "datatype": "FP32",
      "shape": [
         1,
         10
      ],
       "data": [
        -2.26723575592041,
        -7.539040565490723,
        1.4853938817977905,
        1.297321081161499,
        4.158736705780029,
        2.9821133613586426,
        -2.7044689655303955,
        3.2879271507263184,
        -5.1592817306518555,
        -4.101395130157471
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To be able to interpret the predictions, we need to know the classes indexes meaning. The following
is how the classes are indexed:

```text
0: 'airplane'
1: 'automobile'
2: 'bird'
3: 'cat'
4: 'deer'
5: 'dog'
6: 'frog'
7: 'horse'
8: 'ship'
9: 'truck'
```

With that information, we can see that the model correctly predicted that the image is a deer
(higher number on index 4).

### Benchmark the Inference Service

To be able to compare the performance of the model serving on CPU, we can benchmark the inference service.

Run the following command to create a Job workload that will benchmark the inference service:

```bash
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuseml/docs/main/docs/tutorials/img/kserve-triton-gpu/perf.yaml
```

Wait for the Job to complete and check the logs for the results:

```bash
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=complete --timeout 70s job -l app=triton-load-test && kubectl logs -l app=triton-load-test
Requests      [total, rate, throughput]         36000, 600.02, 599.83
Duration      [total, attack, wait]             1m0s, 59.998s, 18.336ms
Latencies     [min, mean, 50, 90, 95, 99, max]  3.328ms, 15.91ms, 7.209ms, 26.135ms, 54.551ms, 205.604ms, 307.993ms
Bytes In      [total, mean]                     11088000, 308.00
Bytes Out     [total, mean]                     5208264000, 144674.00
Success       [ratio]                           100.00%
Status Codes  [code:count]                      200:36000
Error Set:
```

With the benchmark results we can then continue to deploy the model to the GPU, and compare its performance.

## Training & Serving on GPU

Now that the model is validated, we can proceed to train and serve the model with higher accuracy on GPU.

### Training & Serving on GPU with FuseML

1. Update the example workflow so that it will train and serve the model on GPU:

   Open the file `examples/workflows/mlflow-e2e.yaml` with your favorite text editor and make the
   following changes:

   - Change the workflow name to `mlflow-e2e-gpu`.
   - Add the following snippet under the `trainer` step:

     ```yaml
     - name: "trainer"
       ...
       resources:
         limits:
           nvidia.com/gpu: 1
     ```

     This will ensure that the trainer pod will be scheduled to a node that has a GPU.

   - For the `predictor` step, we need to add the following input:

     ```yaml
     - name: predictor
       ...
       inputs:
       ...
         - name: resources_limits
           value: '{nvidia.com/gpu: 1}'
     ```

     This ensures that the workload (KServe inference service) created by this step will be scheduled
     to a node that has a GPU.

2. Unassign the `mlflow-e2e` workflow from the `cifar10`, as we do not want to run the same workflow again:

   ```bash
   $ fuseml workflow unassign -c cifar10 -p demo -n mlflow-e2e
   Workflow "mlflow-e2e" unassigned from codeset "demo/cifar10"
   ```

3. Increase the number of epochs on the `keras` example codeset to 60, so we get model with higher accuracy:

   ```bash
   $ sed -i 's/10/60/' examples/codesets/mlflow/keras/MLproject

   $ fuseml codeset register -n cifar10 -p demo examples/codesets/mlflow/keras
   Pushing the code to the git repository...
   Codeset http://gitea.192.168.86.74.nip.io/demo/cifar10.git successfully registered
   ```

4. Create the `mlflow-e2e-gpu` workflow and assign it to the `cifar10` codeset:

   ```bash
   $ fuseml workflow create examples/workflows/mlflow-e2e.yaml
   Workflow "mlflow-e2e-gpu" successfully created

   $ fuseml workflow assign -c cifar10 -p demo -n mlflow-e2e-gpu
   Workflow "mlflow-e2e-gpu" assigned to codeset "demo/cifar10"
   ```

5. Wait for the workflow run to finish running:

   You can check the status of the workflow run by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ fuseml workflow list-runs
   +------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+------------+-----------+
   | NAME                                     | WORKFLOW       | STARTED        | DURATION   | STATUS    |
   +------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+------------+-----------+
   | fuseml-demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-gpu-pld47 | mlflow-e2e-gpu | 8 seconds ago  | ---        | Running   |
   | fuseml-demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-tkgls     | mlflow-e2e     | 23 minutes ago | 12 minutes | Succeeded |
   +------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+------------+-----------+
   ```

   If you head to the tekton dashboard (`http://tekton.<FUSEML_DOMAIN>`) and look at the logs for the
   `trainer` step, you should be able to see a log confirming that the training is being performed on GPU,
   such as:

   ```bash
   Num GPUs: 1
   1 Physical GPUs, 1 Logical GPUs
   ```

### Validating the Deployed model on GPU

Now that we have the model trained, head over to MLflow (`http://mlflow.<FUSEML_DOMAIN>`) to compare the
training metrics.

For example:

<figure markdown> 
  ![MLflow-GPU](img/kserve-triton-gpu/gpu-mlflow.png)
  <figcaption>Training metrics on GPU</figcaption>
</figure>

With the increased number of epochs, we can see that the trained model have reached an accuracy of 96% while
spending the same amount of time on training!

MLflow also allows comparing other metrics by selecting both runs and clicking on the `Compare` button.

<figure markdown> 
  ![MLflow-Compare](img/kserve-triton-gpu/mlflow-compare.png)
  <figcaption>Comparing metrics on MLflow</figcaption>
</figure>

List the FuseML applications:

```bash
$ fuseml application list
+-----------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| NAME                        | TYPE      | DESCRIPTION                                      | URL                                                                                                                  | WORKFLOW       |
+-----------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-gpu | predictor | Application generated by mlflow-e2e-gpu workflow | http://demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-gpu.fuseml-workloads.192.168.86.74.nip.io/v2/models/demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-gpu/infer | mlflow-e2e-gpu |
| demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e     | predictor | Application generated by mlflow-e2e workflow     | http://demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e.fuseml-workloads.192.168.86.74.nip.io/v2/models/demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e/infer         | mlflow-e2e     |
+-----------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
```

Note that we have the same application, but now it is using the new model and is also using the GPU.
To confirm that, check the inference service logs at
`http://kserve-web-app.<FUSEML_DOMAIN>/details/fuseml-workloads/demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-gpu`,
it should have something like:

```bash
I1019 12:58:00.349814 1 metrics.cc:290] Collecting metrics for GPU 0: NVIDIA XXX
```

Now, just like before, send a request to the application URL.

```bash
$ curl -sX POST http://demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-gpu.fuseml-workloads.192.168.86.74.nip.io/v2/models/demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-gpu/infer -d @examples/prediction/data-keras.json | jq
{
  "model_name": "demo-cifar10-mlflow-e2e-gpu",
  "model_version": "1",
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "dense_1",
      "datatype": "FP32",
      "shape": [
         1,
         10
      ],
      "data": [
        -9.919892311096191,
        -17.90753936767578,
        4.234504699707031,
        2.73684024810791,
        15.640728950500488,
        4.6014084815979,
        -1.7354743480682373,
        10.520237922668457,
        -6.34201717376709,
        -10.711426734924316
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Once again we can confirm that the model correctly predicted that the image is a deer
(higher number on index 4).

### Benchmark the Inference Service on GPU

We can now benchmark the inference service running which uses the GPU to compute predictions.

Run the following command again to benchmark the inference service, you can ignore the (`AlreadyExists` error):

```bash
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuseml/docs/main/docs/tutorials/img/kserve-triton-gpu/perf-gpu.yaml
```

Wait for the Job to complete and check the logs for the results:

```bash hl_lines="4 12"
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=complete --timeout 70s job -l app=triton-load-test && kubectl logs -l app=triton-load-test
Requests      [total, rate, throughput]         36000, 600.02, 599.99

Status Codes  [code:count]                      200:36000
Error Set:
```

The output from the above command shows the benchmark results for the inference service running on GPU (1).
And also the results from the previous run when the model was being served using only the CPU (2).

The interesting results are displayed by the `Latency` metrics. The latency results for the inference service
running on GPU (1) are much lower than the latency results for the inference service running on CPU (2).

## Cleanup

Delete the cluster by running the following command:

```bash
k3d cluster delete fuseml
```

The docker containers created by k3d will be deleted together with all workloads.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we have demonstrated how FuseML can be used to validate, train and serve
ML models on GPU. Additionally, we have demonstrated the use of GPU for inference and training
models quicker. Although the model used in this tutorial is not complex, meaning that it
could have been trained without GPU, it is a good example that enabled us to see how using a
GPU can speed up the training process.
