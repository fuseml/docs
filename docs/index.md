# Welcome to FuseML [fju:zɛmɛl]

## Open Source Orchestration for Machine Learning

FuseML is an MLOps orchestrator powered by a flexible framework designed for consistent operations and a rich collection of integration formulas (recipes) reflecting real world use cases that help you reduce technical debt and avoid vendor lock-in.

We follow 5 simple principles

- **Flexibility** - create and manage dynamic MLOps workflows connecting different AI/ML tools across multiple infrastructure domains

- **Extensibility** - leverage FuseML's set of abstractions and extension mechanisms to add support for your favorite AI/ML tools

- **Composability** - build complex MLOps workflows for your projects out of composable building blocks implementing a wide range of machine learning functions

- **Collaboration** - use MLOps automation and tool integration recipes created in collaboration by all AI/ML team roles - Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and DevOps Engineers

- **GitOps for Machine Learning** - apply the key principles that GitOps is based on, such as versioning and the declarative paradigm to concepts specific to machine learning - e.g. models, datasets, workflows - to provide features such as end-to-end artifact versioning and lineage, tracking, reproducibility and reactive automation
