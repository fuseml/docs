# Welcome to FuseML [fju:zml]

### **F**lexible **U**niversal **SE**rvice orchestration for **M**achine **L**earning

Our goal is to to build a coherent stack of community shared AI/ML tools to run your ML operations. FuseML is powered by a flexible framework designed for consistent operations and a rich collection of integration formulas (recipes) reflecting real world use cases that help you reduce technical debt and avoid vendor lock-in.

We follow 5 simple principles

- **Flexibility** - create and manage dynamic MLOps workflows connecting different AI/ML tools across multiple infrastructure domains

- **Extensibility** - leverage FuseML's set of abstractions and extension mechanisms to add support for your favorite AI/ML tools

- **Composability** - build complex MLOps workflows for your projects out of composable building blocks implementing a wide range of machine learning functions

- **Collaboration** - use MLOps automation and tool integration recipes created in collaboration by all AI/ML team roles - Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and DevOps Engineers

- **GitOps for Machine Learning** - extend what traditional GitOps does with code to all other types of artifacts specific to machine learning - models and datasets, as well as other byproducts of a DevOps workflow (e.g. packages, container images) to provide features such a end-to-end versioning, tracking and reproducibility
